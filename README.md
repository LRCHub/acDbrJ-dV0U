[00:02.82] Well right about that time, people
[00:06.37] A fur trapper who was strictly from commercial (Strictly commercial)
[00:18.99] Had the unmitigated audacity to jump up from behind my igloo (Peek-a-boo, woo-ooh-ooh)
[00:27.20] And he started in to whippin' on my fav'rite baby seal
[00:31.11] With a lead-filled snow shoe
[00:37.72] I said with a lead (Lead)
[00:41.32] Filled (Lead-filled)
[00:43.80] A lead-filled snow shoe (Snow shoe)
[00:46.09] He said "peek-a-boo" (Peek-a-boo)
[00:48.56] With a lead (Lead)
[00:51.36] Filled (Lead-filled)
[00:53.54] With a lead-filled snow shoe (Snow shoe)
[00:56.41] He said "peek-a-boo" (Peek-a-boo)
[01:12.91] 
[00:58.67] He went right up side the head of my favourite baby seal
[01:02.51] He went whap!
[01:03.02] With a lead-filled snow shoe
[01:04.54] An' he hit him on the nose an' he hit him on fin an' he
[01:32.04] 
[01:15.24] That got me just about as evil as an Eskimo boy can be
[01:20.41] So I bent down an' I reached down an' I scooped down
[01:22.85] An' I gathered up a generous mitten full of the deadly (Yellow snow)
[01:28.48] The deadly yellow snow from right there where the huskies go
[01:58.48] 
[01:35.63] Whereupon I proceeded to take that mittenful
[01:37.56] Of the deadly yellow snow crystals
[01:39.25] And rub it all into his beady little eyes
[01:41.19] With a vigorous circular motion
[01:42.42] Hitherto unknown to the people in this area
[01:44.36] But destined to take the place of the mud shark in your mythology
[01:47.27] Here it goes now, the circular motion, rub it
[01:54.65] (Here Fido, here Fido)
[02:05.65] 
[02:01.86] And then, in a fit of anger, I, I pounced
[02:07.60] And I pounced again
[02:13.57] Great googly-moogly!
[02:16.44] I jumped up an' down the chest of the
[02:21.11] I injured the fur trapper
[02:33.61] 
[02:26.67] Well, he was very upset, as you can understand
[02:30.55] And rightly so, because
[02:34.42] The deadly yellow snow crystals
[02:37.00] Had deprived him of his sight
[02:51.50] 
[02:41.25] And he stood up
[02:43.21] And he looked around
[02:45.57] And he said
[02:46.61] "I can't see" (Do, do do-do do do-do, yeah!)
[02:52.06] "I can't see" (Do, do do-do do do-do, yeah!)
[02:56.18] "Oh, woe is me" (Do, do do-do do do-do, yeah!)
[03:01.29] "I can't see" (Do, do do-do do do-do, well!)
[03:10.77] No, no
[03:14.90] I can't see
[03:18.03] No, I
[03:20.53] 
[03:27.41] He took a dog-doo sno-cone an' stuffed it in my right eye
[03:32.61] He took a dog-doo sno-cone an' stuffed it in my other eye
[03:37.78] An' the huskie wee-wee, I mean the doggie wee-wee, has blinded me
[03:42.70] An' I can't see
[03:45.15] Temporarily
[03:50.65] 
[03:48.85] Well, the fur trapper
[03:51.05] Stood there
[03:53.35] With his arms outstretched
[03:55.78] Across the frozen white wasteland
[03:58.72] Trying to figure out what he's gonna do about his deflicted eyes
[04:03.22] And it was at that precise moment that he remembered an ancient Eskimo legend
[04:07.83] Wherein it is written
[04:09.98] And whatever it is that they write it on up there
[04:14.33] That if anything bad ever happens to your eyes
[04:16.30] As a result of some sort of conflict with anyone named Nanook
[04:20.53] The only way you can get it fixed up
[04:24.03] Is to go trudgin' across the tundra, mile after mile
[04:30.88] Trudgin' across the tundra
[04:33.17] Right down to the parish of Saint Alfonzo
